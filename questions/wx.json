            "question": "how can i disable all controlls but tree and then enable all of them once tree item was selected and it's not root in wxpython ",
            "answer": "You can disable all the controls by using Disable() method for each control, and then re-enable once an tree item is selected and it's not a root item, by using Enable() method.\n\nFirst, you need to create a list of all your controls in your interface and save it somewhere in your instance, the moment you want to disable or enable the controls, refer to this list.\n\nHere's an example in pseudocode context:\n\n```python\nclass MyApp(wx.Frame):\n    def __init__(self):\n        wx.Frame.__init__(self, None)\n        \n        # create several controls\n        self.button = wx.Button(self, label=\"Button\")\n        self.textctrl = wx.TextCtrl(self)\n        self.checkbox = wx.CheckBox(self, label=\"Checkbox\")\n        \n        # add controls to a list \n        self.controls = [self.button, self.textctrl, self.checkbox] \n        \n        # create a tree\n        self.tree = wx.TreeCtrl(self)\n        root = self.tree.AddRoot(\"Root\")\n        child = self.tree.AppendItem(root, \"Child\")\n        \n        # bind tree selection event\n        self.Bind(wx.EVT_TREE_SEL_CHANGED, self.OnTreeSelectionChanged, self.tree)\n\n    def OnTreeSelectionChanged(self, event):\n        item = event.GetItem()\n        \n        # if it's not a root, enable all other controls\n        if item != self.tree.GetRootItem():\n            self.enable_all_controls(True)\n        else:\n            self.enable_all_controls(False)\n                \n    def enable_all_controls(self, enable):\n        # iterate over all controls and enable/disable them\n        for control in self.controls:\n            control.Enable(enable)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app = wx.App()\n    frame = MyApp()\n    frame.Show()\n    app.MainLoop()\n```\nPlease replace the `button`, `textctrl` and `checkbox` with the actual controls that you have in your application as the above snippet is a simple representation of how to disable/enable controls in wxPython.\n\nThis snippet will disable the controls initially and keep them disabled until a tree item (which is not root) selected and re-enabled when a non-root item for the tree is selected."

            "answer": "In wxPython, you can disable controls by using the `Disable()` and enable controls by using `Enable()`. These methods provided by most widgets and set whether or not the user can interact with the widget.\n\nHere is a general example:\n\n```python\nimport wx\n\nclass Mywin(wx.Frame): \n   def __init__(self, parent, title): \n      super(Mywin, self).__init__(parent, title = title, size = (300,300)) \n      \n      self.panel = wx.Panel(self) \n           \n      vbox = wx.BoxSizer(wx.VERTICAL) \n      hbox = wx.BoxSizer(wx.HORIZONTAL) \n\n      self.tree = wx.TreeCtrl(self.panel, -1)  # Create the tree control\n      self.tree.Bind(wx.EVT_TREE_SEL_CHANGED, self.on_tree_selection)  # Bind an event handler to the tree selection event\n      \n      self.button = wx.Button(self.panel, -1, \"Button\")  # Create a button\n      self.button.Disable()  # Initially disable the button\n       \n      vbox.Add(self.tree, 1, flag = wx.EXPAND) \n      vbox.Add(self.button, 0,  flag = wx.ALIGN_CENTER) \n               \n      self.panel.SetSizer(vbox)  \n          \n      self.Centre() \n      self.Show(True) \n      \n   def on_tree_selection(self, event):\n      item = event.GetItem()  # Get the selected item\n      if not self.tree.ItemHasChildren(item):  # If the selected item is not a root i.e., it has no children\n         for child in self.panel.GetChildren():  # For each control in the panel\n            child.Enable()  # Enable the control\n\napp = wx.App() \nMywin(None,\"TreeCtrl Demo\") \napp.MainLoop() \n```\n\nThis is a basic example, your actual code may have other complexities. This code creates a wxPython GUI with a tree control and a button. Initially, the button is disabled. But when a leaf item (an item with no children) in the tree is selected, all controls in the panel are enabled, including the button.",
