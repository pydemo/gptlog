            "question": "how can i disable all controlls but tree and then enable all of them once tree item was selected and it's not root in wxpython ",
            "answer": "You can disable all the controls by using Disable() method for each control, and then re-enable once an tree item is selected and it's not a root item, by using Enable() method.\n\nFirst, you need to create a list of all your controls in your interface and save it somewhere in your instance, the moment you want to disable or enable the controls, refer to this list.\n\nHere's an example in pseudocode context:\n\n```python\nclass MyApp(wx.Frame):\n    def __init__(self):\n        wx.Frame.__init__(self, None)\n        \n        # create several controls\n        self.button = wx.Button(self, label=\"Button\")\n        self.textctrl = wx.TextCtrl(self)\n        self.checkbox = wx.CheckBox(self, label=\"Checkbox\")\n        \n        # add controls to a list \n        self.controls = [self.button, self.textctrl, self.checkbox] \n        \n        # create a tree\n        self.tree = wx.TreeCtrl(self)\n        root = self.tree.AddRoot(\"Root\")\n        child = self.tree.AppendItem(root, \"Child\")\n        \n        # bind tree selection event\n        self.Bind(wx.EVT_TREE_SEL_CHANGED, self.OnTreeSelectionChanged, self.tree)\n\n    def OnTreeSelectionChanged(self, event):\n        item = event.GetItem()\n        \n        # if it's not a root, enable all other controls\n        if item != self.tree.GetRootItem():\n            self.enable_all_controls(True)\n        else:\n            self.enable_all_controls(False)\n                \n    def enable_all_controls(self, enable):\n        # iterate over all controls and enable/disable them\n        for control in self.controls:\n            control.Enable(enable)\n\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app = wx.App()\n    frame = MyApp()\n    frame.Show()\n    app.MainLoop()\n```\nPlease replace the `button`, `textctrl` and `checkbox` with the actual controls that you have in your application as the above snippet is a simple representation of how to disable/enable controls in wxPython.\n\nThis snippet will disable the controls initially and keep them disabled until a tree item (which is not root) selected and re-enabled when a non-root item for the tree is selected."
